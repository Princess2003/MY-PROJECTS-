        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>In the heart of Pretoria, nestled near the University of Pretoria’s Hatfield Campus, Reliable House stands as a beacon of hope for homeless men seeking to overcome substance abuse and reintegrate into society. Established in 2016 by UP’s unit for Community Engagement, this initiative transformed a once-neglected site at the corner of Park and Festival Streets—formerly a haven for drug addicts and a garbage dump—into a thriving no-harm and training center. Reliable House is not just a shelter; it’s a collaborative effort involving UP students, faculty, and the broader community to create positive change and empower individuals.

            Under this program, over 600 tons of rubbish were cleared to make way for 12 Wendy houses, providing transitional housing for up to 34 men at a time. These “change-makers,” as the residents prefer to be called, engage in a comprehensive recovery program that can last from six months to two years, focusing on rehabilitation, skill-building, and reintegration. The site features a clinic, a sick bay, a library, a training center, and renovated ablution facilities, offering a holistic support system that addresses physical, social, and psychological needs.
            
            Reliable House reflects UP's commitment to community engagement, with involvement from nearly all faculties through curriculum-related activities. Each year, more than 20,000 UP students participate in community projects, contributing to the university’s role in the global University Social Responsibility Network. Engineering students, for example, have installed gutters to collect rainwater for the site’s vegetable gardens, demonstrating how academic skills can be applied to real-world challenges.
            
            The program’s impact extends beyond the campus, fostering a stronger sense of community responsibility. Through partnerships between the university, local businesses, and residents, Reliable House exemplifies how collective efforts can address societal issues. As Gernia van Niekerk, UP’s unit manager for Community Engagement, states, the project teaches that “nobody is more important than anyone else,” emphasizing the value of each individual’s contribution to the greater good.
            
            Reliable House offers more than a place to stay—it provides a pathway to a better future. Through identity document replacement, bank account setup, job placement assistance, food gardens, skills training, motivational talks, and therapy, the men at Reliable House are equipped to rebuild their lives and transition back into society. By recognizing the need to support rather than exclude homeless individuals, Reliable House serves as a model for how communities can come together to create lasting, meaningful change.</p>
